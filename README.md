### T. Sawi, N. Groebner, B. Holtzman
#### Based on the 2022 paper, in prep. "An Unsupervised Machine-Learning Approach to Understanding Seismicity at an Alpine Glacier"; by T. Sawi, B. Holtzman, M. Nettles, F. walter and J. Paisley. 


Preprocessing steps to convert a folder of waveforms to HDF5 of spectrograms. For icequakes, the location catalog is incorporated into the H5 file.
